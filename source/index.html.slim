  | Hi! I'm looking for full-time remote job opportunity as Ruby on Rails engineer with expertise in front-end development. I have been building Web since 2005 on different positions. Usually â€“ as remote  specialist, so I have professional experience working remotely and perfect skills of self-organization.

  h2.block__title Technical skills
  | Completed my first project on the second branch of Ruby on Rails in 2010, and since then have been desperately in love with RoR. I'm an expert with the framework ecosystem and know the system inside &amp; out. I'm highly skilled at using all popular (and not so popular) gems for various tasks, &amp; have also been a contributor to some of them. I have created millions &amp; millions of applications from the ground up, &amp; some of them are used in production today :). I have used MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB databases, Thin, Unicorn and Puma application servers in all of my projects. I have an excellent understanding of RSpec and TDD approach. I'm in LOVE with git &amp; deploy via Capistrano.
